			<p>RimWorld is a game about establishing a colony on a remote planet sometime in the distant future. There's a whole Western vibe, resulting in a sort of Firefly-esque setting. It's a life simulator, a genre about a more hand-off approach to strategy and management, where you manipulate AI behaviour instead of controlling it directly. RimWorld sits somewhere between The Sims and Dungeon Keeper, though its presentation and style are reminiscent of games like Prison Architect. It's a story generator, promising to co-author all manner of wild tales for players. </p>

			<p>This isn't about creating the perfect colony, this is about creating drama. This means things going wrong, that the unexpected has to occur and that your characters have complicated motivations. They're given drives and needs, ones that are often extremely unhelpful to the mission but which are intended to make them more complex and rounded. Go in wanting to build a perfect little colony and you'll likely be frustrated. Accept the game's penchant for disaster and you'll have a much better time.</p>

		   <p>I agree for the most part with this author's statement. Rimworld is a great game that I thoroughly enjoy. The game does not let you interact with the world directly instead giving orders and setting a schedule for settlers of the colony you are building. You experience the world through your colonists or as the game calls them "pawns."</p>
		   <p>one thing I don't agree with in this review is that the game does not work as a story generator. the game is meant to be looked back upon after finishing the game so that you can see all the individual events that happened throughout your runthough. the game is always able to create unexpected situations in order to make said story as interesting as possible when read later.</p>
