		this article stood out and was very interesting to me, my family was also a pretty early adopter of the internet <br>
		my grandfather was kind enough to gift us an early Apple computer and I can remember playing games like Pajama Sam on it <br>
		one thing that really stood out to me about this article was this part about how the internet cannibalizes itself <br>
		"The new internet knows this, and it capitalizes on my nostalgia as it eats away at the old internet. It amounts to an unforeseen form of technological cannibalism." <br>
		I do somewhat agree with this the internet is a constant cycle of taking what already exists within it and iterating on it <br>
		while I do agree with that part of the essay, the part that I don't agree with is that this is a bad thing. <br>
		The author talks about their nostalgia and how that feeling gets taken advantage of in order to draw in your click. <br>
		The internet has always been self-referential always taking things from its past in order to make today's experience a little bit better. <br>
		people tend to think that the older the period of the internet was the better it was, and while sometimes that can be true it isn't always. <br>
		While I believe the freedom that the internet offered was good I don't believe that that it always means that's a good thing. <br>
		Being able to find any website about any topic no matter how bad the website is while cool is not always the best thing. <br>
		One thing that was really interesting to me about this article was the impermanence of digital media because this was something I did not know about. <br>
		"Considering the average website is less than ten years old, that old warning from your parents that says to 'be careful what you post online because it'll be there forever' is like the story your dad told you about chocolate milk coming from brown cows, a well-meant farce. On the contrary, librarians and archivists have implored us for years to be wary of the impermanence of digital media; when a website, especially one that invites mass participation, goes offline or executes a huge dump of its data and resources, it's as if a smallish Library of Alexandria has been burned to the ground. Except unlike the burning of such a library, when a website folds, the ensuing commentary from tech blogs asks only why the company folded, or why a startup wasn't profitable. Ignored is the scope and species of the lost material, or what it might have meant to the scant few who are left to salvage the digital wreck." <br>
		This part of the essay is very interesting to me, I did not know that websites purged all of their data before going offline, I had always been told about the permanence of the internet and to be careful what I post.<br>
		while I do find that part of the essay interesting there is a part that I disagree with. I believe that the deletion of the data is also a good thing, that because of the impermanence of the website you cherish it more than you would otherwise <br>
		the other part I disagree with is the part about how people react to the fall of a website, the essay states that when a website falls or goes offline instead of looking at why the website failed they instead look at the company behind it.<br>
		This stood out as weird to me because a company failing is usually the reason their website gets taken down, company's don't really delete their own websites without themselves going under first.
		In the end I found the essay to a very interesting retrospective on the internet. <br>
